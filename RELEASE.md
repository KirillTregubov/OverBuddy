## What is OverBuddy

OverBuddy is a free, open source Windows app that lets you easily customize your Overwatch™ 2 main menu. Whether you're a Doomfist main who wants to keep Tropical Doomfist, an Overwatch League™ fan who wants a reminder of the old days, or you just can't get over the look and sound of the last collaboration event, OverBuddy has you covered.

## What Makes It Special

### Works on PC

OverBuddy works seamlessly with both Battle.net® and Steam® installations of Overwatch™ 2 on Windows.

### Personalize your Experience

Browse all available Overwatch™ menu backgrounds and apply your favourite to see it in game the next time you play.

### Built with Privacy in Mind

To change the menu background, OverBuddy updates your Battle.net® and/or Steam® configuration files. It does **NOT** modify any game files and does **NOT** collect your personal data. Changes are applied after OverBuddy automatically restarts your Battle.net and/or Steam client.

You don't have to take my word for it! The source code is openly available for anyone, including you, to review and contribute to.

### One-Click Revert

Change your mind? Click the `Revert to Default` button at any time to remove all customizations.

### Debug Console

OverBuddy can enable the Overwatch debug console, accessible in-game using the `Alt` + `~` hotkey.
