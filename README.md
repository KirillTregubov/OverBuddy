## Description

OverBuddy is a free and open source Windows app that allows Overwatch players to easily customize their in-game main menu background. Say goodbye to the default look and personalize your menu background today.

## Features

- Supports Battle.net® and Steam® installations of Overwatch™ 2 on Windows
- Browse all currently available backgrounds
- Apply your favourite background to see it in-game
- Easily revert to the default background if you change your mind
- Enable the Overwatch debug console, accessible in-game using the `Alt` + `~` hotkey

## Privacy Notice

- **Reads and Writes Configuration**: OverBuddy needs to read and write your Battle.net and/or Steam configuration files to change your background. It does **NOT** modify any game files and does **NOT** collect your personal data.
- **Automatically Restarts Game Clients**: Changes are applied after automatically restarting your Battle.net and/or Steam client.

## Inspiration

As with all software, OverBuddy is built on the shoulders of giants.

I would like to extend my gratitude to [SkyBorik](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MRPRP30) for showing the community [How to change Main Menu background](https://web.archive.org/web/20250124072732/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3099694051), to [Toyz](https://github.com/Toyz) for publishing the [Overwatch command line arguments](https://gist.github.com/Toyz/30e6fd504c713511f67f1a607025b0bc), and to the [OverTools Team](https://github.com/overtools) for their [OWLib tool](https://github.com/overtools/OWLib). This app would not have been possible without their contributions to the community.
